What is AI?

1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These include problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, and pattern recognition.

2. AI is categorized into different types, including Narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks like recommendation systems, and General AI, which aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.

3. Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, involves training algorithms to learn from data and make predictions. Deep learning, a branch of ML, uses neural networks to recognize patterns in complex data.
